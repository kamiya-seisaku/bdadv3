Hi.
Today I want to a show demo 
and show you how you can make a 
HUD-like user interface using blender + python.

First we want some model.  Here I am importing my bicycle model, 
that bike has a rider girl and 
some animations already assigned.

If you look at the NLA editor, the bike has some actions going on.
The girl rig also has some actions running in this scene.

In the 3D view, the bike goes up and goes out of sight.

Lets first attach the camera to the bike so it stays focused on the bike.

The simplest way to do this is to parent the camera to the bike.

Parenting it to the bike, now camera keeps looking at the bike.

Now camera is looking light into the bike.

Lets add some background objects so we can see how the bike is moving.

Now we can see the bike is flying above the cubes.  Yeah this bike flies.

Lets moving the camera, so we see the path better.

Now we are set.  We want to have a text object and show some info there.

Select the camera and add a text object.  Change the name of the text object to ui.

Move it to where you want in the sight.

Parent it to the camera.  Lets play the animation.

The text comes perfectly with the camera, so it looks like a head up display for the player.

You can change the text however you like.  But we want it change.

Now the python part.
